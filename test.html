    'A probiotic for our lungs? New research poses questions about the future of treating COVID-19 The results of new research into the effects of COVID-19 have suggested that a mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection can lead to alterations of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiota, including a reduction in bacterial diversity and community structure that persists for at least several weeks after the initial infection. Researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA, observed a relationship between the URT microbiota and the severity of COVID symptoms in their patients. They hope this could lead to new therapy methods to reduce the effects of COVID-19 in the future.',
